In the bridge pattern there are mainly four classes in the diagram:
1-Implementor: interface that is going to be used in the abstraction class
2-Concrete Implementor: implementations of the Implementor
3-abstraction: Interface or abstract class that has Implementor
4-Concrete abstraction: Implementations of the abstract interface


In this example I just wanted to say that I took it from christopher's
playlist (he explains design patterns that are in the head first design 
pattern in a great way I advise you If you wanna learn design patterns
to watch his playlist or read headfirst design patterns both are good.)
