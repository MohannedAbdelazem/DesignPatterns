The intent of the bridge pattern is to decouple an abstraction from it's implementation so that the two can vary independently (The definition is not from headfirst and to be honest I really don't like this definition so I got another definition from this link which I really advise you to look into because this site provided me with pretty good explanations https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge)
