# Intro

The Factory Pattern mainly consists of three types:
    -Simple Factory (not a design pattern (won't talk about it)).
    -Factory method
    -Abstract factory

# Factory Method Definition

The factory method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but let subclass decides what to instansiate.
factory mathod lets' class defer instantiation to subclasses.

# Abstract Factory Definition

The abstract factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.(It's kind of the same idea of the factory method but with multiple factory mehtods).
