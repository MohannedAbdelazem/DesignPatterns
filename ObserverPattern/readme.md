# Definition

In essence the observer pattern consists of an observer and an observable once the observable changes it notifies the observers (or at least that's the way I think of it).
As for the definition in the book it states that the observer pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that one object changes state all of its' dependencies are notified and updated automatically.
