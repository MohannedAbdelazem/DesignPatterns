# Note

Just an important side note, there are allot of arguments that you should never use singleton pattern in your code
also singleton pattern does use static keyword which also has a number of arguments about whether or not to use it.
Just thought that this is worth mentioning before I start.

# Definition

The singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. (that's basically just it).
