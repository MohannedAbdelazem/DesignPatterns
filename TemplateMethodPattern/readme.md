# Definition

The template method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation defering some steps to subclasses.
Template method pattern let subclasss redefine some steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm structure.`
(Also kinda supports the open/closed principle since you can alter the algorithm without changing the source code).
